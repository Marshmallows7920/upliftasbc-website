## Bio
Hello Art Students! My name is Camryn Anderson (she/her) and I am a fourth year political studies student in the Faculty of Arts. I am pleased to announce that I will be running with my team Uplift ASBC for the position of Vice President. As a current UMSU Director for ASBC I have learned the importance of providing support to students in a virtual setting and I am excited to continue this in the next term. This will be implemented by growing ASBC’s Holiday Relief Fund to twice a year, engaging with students wanting to get involved with ASBC through the Director of Community Engagement and expanding mental health resources by connecting the University with different resources. With this in mind, I am excited for what Uplift ASBC can do for arts students and confident in our abilities. 

Vote Uplift ASBC and myself as Vice President on March 25 and 26.


## Policies
- Expansion of ASBC’s Holiday Relief Fund biannually
- Creation of a volunteer inventory program to increase student involvement in ASBC and the Arts community
- External partnerships with community organizations to develop mental health-focused programming
