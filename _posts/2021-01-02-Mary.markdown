Hello everyone! My name is Mary and I am a Political Studies Student! Iâ€™m running to become one of your senators for the upcoming school year with my team, Uplift ASBC. If Elected, I will commit to being approachable and accessible for my fellow Arts students at all times, across all social media platforms. During my time as Senator I will continually hold UMSU accountable, as well as push for priority class enrollment for graduating students. I also want to lobby for trauma sensitivity training to be available for all students as well. I intend for these policies to be number 1 on my agenda for the upcoming school year. If you have any questions, please get in touch with me! Follow us @uplift.asbc or check out our website upliftasbc.com.

## Policies

- Advocate for trauma sensitivity training be accessible to all students.
- Push for more funding for the faculty of arts, in order to create more opportunities for students (ex, more summer courses, grants for arts functions).
