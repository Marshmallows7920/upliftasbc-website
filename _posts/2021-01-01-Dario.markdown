## Bio
Hello, my name is Dario Duque Giraldo [He/Him/They] and I am a second year Sociology and Religion student in the Faculty of Arts! I am proud to say that I will be running with my team Uplift ASBC for one of the UMSU Director positions representing the Faculty of Arts. I am currently the Racialized Representative for the Art Student Body Council. 
Through my experiences this past year I have been able to inform myself on the representation that matters most now, specially in the UMSU Board of Directors. I am thrilled to have the possibility of being able to continue representing both racialized and LGBTQ+ students, as well as all other students, as a proud gay latino. 
I am confident that both my team, Uplift ASBC and myself as an UMSU Director are the right voices for arts students. 
Vote Uplift ASBC on March 25 and 26!

## Policies

- Represent marginalized student groups in the UMSU BOD
- Take action regarding the rights of arts students during Board of Director meetings 
- Keep relevant student groups informed on motions that may affect different aspects of their university life.
