Hey, Arts students! My name is Jaron Rykiss and I am a second-year philosophy and political studies student. This year, I hope to become one of your UMSU directors! I want to make the university feel like home for everyone. We should be proud to wear the UofM logo and call ourselves Bison. So, I am focusing my platform on the unification of all students from every faculty by increasing the amount of communication between different faculty boards, programming, and planning events with ALL students in mind! As a student with ADHD, I want to focus on supporting students like me. Often seen as a disorder that makes people “loud” or “hyper”, it is not just those things. People with ADHD often are more prone to anxiety, depression, and struggle with academic learning. I want to make sure the university feels like a safe place for all of us. Even the ones who feel they aren’t achieving at the level they’d like to be! If you’d like to hear more about myself or my team, Uplift ASBC, Follow me @jaronrykiss and @upliftasbc, on Instagram! Additionally, check out our website for more info! I’m always around and I’d love to hear from you! Make sure to vote Uplift ASBC on March 25th and 26th! 

## Policies

- Providing lines of communication between the board and the Arts student body
- Emphasize support and resources for students with ADHD and other mental illnesses
- Work to create programming and systems that involve the 
leadership from all faculties, which will heighten the level 
of involvement across the university.
