## Bio

Hello Arts students!

Hope you are doing well. My name is Fardeen Zareef and I am a 3rd year Economics Student in the Faculty of Arts. It gives me great pleasure to announce that I am running to be your Arts Student Body Council President along with my team Uplift ASBC.As the current Co-Director of Communications for ASBC, I have had the honour of working in most of the core ASBC projects with improving engagement being the main focus. I firsthand got to experience and understand what our students want and expect from their student body. As an international student and a person of colour, I identify with the gap in communication and engagement for marginalized students and I am aware of the importance and need to provide support for our students especially as we tackle these unprecedented times together. It would be our honour to carry forward and expand on the work that ASBC has done so far.

We aim to implement our initiatives by bolstering engagement with students in Arts and increasing awareness of how to get involved with ASBC through our Community representatives and our Director of Community Engagement, centralizing ASBCâ€™s platforms so that all students, clubs and organizations within the Arts faculty can use it to promote their projects, increasing our Holiday Relief Fund to twice a year, expanding and updating mental health and stress relief resources by connecting with local organizations, increasing awareness on the importance of sustainability in university. I am really excited about what Uplift ASBC can do for Arts students and I am confident that with our abilities and experience, we are the right way forward. On March 25th and 26th, vote for progress, vote Uplift ASBC and vote for me to be your President.
